                                        Mozart</a> was born on January 27, 1756, in Salzburg, Austria. His father, <a

                                        Mozart</a>, a noted composer, instructor, and the author of famous writings on
                                    violin playing, was then in the service of the archbishop of Salzburg. Leopold and
                                    Anna Maria, his wife, stressed the importance of music to their children. Together
                                    with his sister, Nannerl, Wolfgang received such intensive musical training that by
                                    the age of six he was a budding composer and an accomplished keyboard performer. In
                                    1762 Leopold presented his son as performer at the imperial court in Vienna,
                                    Austria, and from 1763 to 1766 he escorted both children on a continuous musical
                                    tour across Europe, which included long stays in Paris, France, and London, England,
                                    as well as visits to many other cities, with appearances before the French and
                                    English royal families.

                                    Mozart was the most celebrated child prodigy (an unusually gifted child) of this
                                    time as a keyboard performer. He also made a great impression as a composer and
                                    improviser (one who arranges or creates). In London he won the admiration of
                                    musician Johann Christian Bach (1735–1782), and he was exposed from an early age to
                                    an unusual variety of musical styles and tastes across Europe.

                                    From the age of ten to seventeen, Mozart's reputation as a composer grew to a degree
                                    of maturity equal to that of most older established musicians. He spent the years
                                    from 1766 to 1769 at Salzburg writing instrumental works and music for school dramas
                                    in German and Latin, and in 1768 he produced his first real operas: the German
                                    Singspiel (that is, with spoken dialogue) Bastien und Bastienne. Despite his growing
                                    reputation, Mozart found no suitable post open to him; and his father once more
                                    escorted Mozart, at age fourteen (1769), and set off for Italy to try to make his
                                    way as an opera composer.

                                    In Italy, Mozart was well received: in Milan, Italy, he obtained a commission for an
                                    opera; in Rome he was made a member of an honorary knightly order by the Pope; and
                                    at Bologna, Italy, the Accademia Filarmonica awarded him membership despite a rule
                                    normally requiring candidates to be twenty years old. During these years of travel
                                    in Italy and returns to Salzburg between journeys, he produced his first large-scale
                                    settings of opera seria (that is, court opera on serious subjects): Mitridate
                                    (1770), Ascanio in Alba (1771), and Lucio Silla (1772), as well as his first string
                                    quartets. At Salzburg in late 1771 he renewed his writing of Symphonies.

                                                            The traditionally used name of the work comes from the entry

                                                            The work was not published until about 1827, long after

                                                            compositions.

                                                            Today, the serenade is widely performed and recorded;

                                                            Mozart composed Sonata No. 11 at the age of around 27 -
                                                            perhaps
                                                            in 1783 in Vienna or Salzburg. The third and final movement,
                                                            known popularly as the Turkish March, is in the rondo form,
                                                            and
                                                            was entitled 'Alla Turca' by Mozart himself.

                                                            At the time Mozart wrote Sonata No. 11, the music of Turkish

                                                            thought to be the oldest form of military marching bands in

                                                            empire in his opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail, which is

                                                            Mozart's quick, simple, yet rustic melody has become so

                                                            and the Divertimento, K. 136 (one of three such works Mozart
                                                            composed during the winter of 1772), was probably a nice way

                                                            We don't know much about these divertimentos - in fact, the

                                                            was
                                                            away from home, which explains why gaps in our knowledge
                                                            inevitably surround his Salzburg compositions. He probably
                                                            wrote

                                                            performed on both keyboard and violin. (At the time, his
                                                            official position in Salzburg was as concertmaster of the

                                                            467, was completed on 9 March 1785 by Wolfgang Amadeus
                                                            Mozart,
                                                            four weeks after the completion of the previous D minor
                                                            concerto, K. 466.
                                                            The opening movement begins quietly with a march figure, but
                                                            quickly moves to a more lyrical melody interspersed with a
                                                            fanfare in the winds. The music grows abruptly in volume,
                                                            with
                                                            the violins taking up the principal melody over the march
                                                            theme,
                                                            which is now played by the brass. This uplifting theme
                                                            transitions to a brief, quieter interlude distinguished by a
                                                            sighing motif in the brass. The march returns, eventually
                                                            transitioning to the entrance of the soloist. The soloist
                                                            plays
                                                            a brief Eingang (a type of abbreviated cadenza) before
                                                            resolving
                                                            to a trill on the dominant G while the strings play the
                                                            march in
                                                            C major. The piano then introduces new material in C major
                                                            and
                                                            begins transitioning to the dominant key of G major.
                                                            Immediately
                                                            after an orchestral cadence finally announces the arrival of
                                                            the
                                                            dominant, the music abruptly shifts to G minor in a passage
                                                            that
                                                            is reminiscent of the main theme of the Symphony No. 40 in

                                                            transition the music to the true second theme of the piece,

                                                            Third Horn Concerto. The usual development and

                                                            material of the movement is contained in this orchestral
                                                            introduction, in either F major or F minor. The second
                                                            section
                                                            introduces the solo piano and starts off in F major. It is
                                                            not a
                                                            literal repeat, though, as after the first few phrases, new
                                                            material is interjected which ventures off into different
                                                            keys.
                                                            When familiar material returns, the music is now in the
                                                            dominant
                                                            keys of C minor and C major. Then it modulates to G minor,
                                                            then
                                                            B-flat major, then F minor, which transitions to the third
                                                            section of the movement. The third section begins with the
                                                            dreamlike melody again, but this time in the relative key of
                                                            F
                                                            major's parallel key, A-flat major. Over the course of this
                                                            final section, the music makes its way back to the tonic
                                                            keys of
                                                            F minor and then F major and a short coda concludes the
                                                            movement.

                                                            Mozart's
                                                            widow Constanze. She was responsible for a number of stories
                                                            surrounding the composition of the work, including the
                                                            claims
                                                            that Mozart received the commission from a mysterious
                                                            messenger
                                                            who did not reveal the commissioner's identity, and that
                                                            Mozart
                                                            came to believe that he was writing the requiem for his own

                                                            major, is in three parts. The opening section is for
                                                            orchestra

                                                            dreamlike melody over an accompaniment consisting of second

                                                            material of the movement is contained in this orchestral

                                                            material is interjected which ventures off into different

                                                            When familiar material returns, the music is now in the
                                                            dominant
                                                            keys of C minor and C major. Then it modulates to G minor,
                                                            then

                                                            section of the movement. The third section begins with the
                                                            dreamlike melody again, but this time in the relative key of

                                                            final section, the music makes its way back to the tonic
                                                            keys of
                                                            F minor and then F major and a short coda concludes the
                                                            movement.
